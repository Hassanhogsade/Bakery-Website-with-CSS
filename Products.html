    <p>A cheese and onion pasty is a classic. We love serving them for dinner, with homemade chips and baked beans – a plate of orange food at its finest. But you could just as easily enjoy yours with a quick pickle on a picnic, as they taste great hot or cold. However you eat them, we recommend a good shake of malt vinegar. So come and try our fresh baked pasties in store!</p>

    <p>ust imagine biting into these mouth-watering, fluffy and indulgent yum yums. I’m not joking when I say they taste amazing! They’re so good people can’t stop eating them and they’re quite simple to make too! Some people do confuse a Yum-Yum for a Donut as they both come glazed. A yum yum is a twisted doughnut dough glazed with icing. This is deep-fried, covered in a sugar glaze, then topped with decorations. </p>

    <p>A pain au chocolat, also called a chocolatine or chocolate croissant in southwestern France and in French Canada, is a viennoiserie sweet roll consisting of a cuboid-shaped piece of yeast-leavened laminated dough, similar in texture to a puff pastry, with one or two pieces of chocolate in the centre. Pain au chocolat is made of the same layered doughs as a croissant. Often sold still hot or warm from the oven. Warm, golden pastries fresh from the oven could soon be yours.</p>
